Test Results
=================================================

The output files generated by running the JUnit tests on your code will be saved in this subdirectory. 

If you fail a test, select the file of output generated by your code in this subdirectory. Then, select the expected output file (using ctrl+click) in the "output" subdirectory at the same time. With both files selected, right-click and select "Compare With" then "Each Other" to see the two files side by side for debugging.
